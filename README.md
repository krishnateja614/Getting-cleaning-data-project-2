The code takes for granted all the data is present in the foldernamed "getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset" in the woring directory, un-compressed and without names altered.

CodeBook.md describes transformations that were performed to clean up the data.

run_analysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps. They can be launched in RStudio by just importing the file.

The code writes a file called tidydata.txt to the working directory, and the same is uploaded in the course project's form.
